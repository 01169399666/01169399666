<td><font face = "Lato">Hi and welcome back to my website page! This time, I am going to share my thought and experiences of my hostel life during my secondary school at <abbr title="Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan">SMK</abbr> Raja Chulan, Ipoh, Perak (2014-2018). Let’s get into it!
<br>
<br>
	First of all, hostel life is such a fun, amusing, and youthfulness experience that I had. It is a life where I always keep in touch and communicate with my peers, senior students, and junior students. It was like I had a second family that I had to take care of and go through life together during my school days. Also, there are a lot of advantages in learning when being a hostel student.
<br>
<br>
	When I was in form one where I was 13, my parents decided for me to stay in the dormitory because my parents were still working and it was difficult for them to send me to school on time. At first, I felt very nervous because I had never lived away from my parents in my entire life but when I got a classmate who was also sitting in the dorm, I felt a little relieved. After finishing preparing to enter the dormitory, we registered and brought my belongings into the dormitory. Back then, all the dorm students from seniors, juniors, and peers looked at me with full curiosity. We need to get to know each other because we will stay together for a long time and work together in any matter.
<br>
<br>
	Having finished going into the dorm, choosing the bed, and packing my belongings, the night of the dorm or my room there made a reunion to introduce the new dorm students, and yes I introduced myself in front of my dorm mates around the number of 25 to 30 people so. The senior also introduced me to the hostel system, the way of life, what to do and what not to do in the hostel, and so on. At first, I found it difficult to accustom myself to the new atmosphere of life and caused me to feel very homesick for my parents. But that was just the beginning, long ago when I had started to get close to them all, my life there became easy and very happy even though misunderstandings often happened between us boarding students, the thing we were able to overcome slowly as we grew up.

<td colspan="3"><font face = "Lato">There are many advantages of sitting in a dormitory, among them is that we have a television room, a special library for dormitory students, the reading room next to the library, a study room, facilities for indoor and outdoor games such as basketball, volleyball, badminton, etc. Life in this hostel is a community life where we do all things together especially when the hostel administrator organizes hostel programs. Enjoying hostel tours and feasts is my favorite moment in the school days where previously we held motivational tours, camping, participating in outdoor events as representatives of our school, glorious nights every year-end, festive celebrations, and so on. Life in a hostel is much more cheerful and carefree if we are good at taking care of ourselves physically, mentally, and spiritually.
<br>
<br>
	Also, in terms of students, peers, seniors, and juniors in the dormitory, there are various types and varieties of students in the dormitory, some are diligent learners where they are always busy with lessons, some are naughty, and some spend time playing or bullying others. This is also one of the things that need to be emphasized in dormitory life, which is to be independent and manage wisely as a dormitory student. I should not abuse time but instead use time in lessons, games, debates, group discussions, and other beneficial activities. In the dormitory as well, students have to do some work on their own such as taking care of belongings, washing clothes, making beds, and so on.
<br>
<br>
	In other words, we can learn to be independent and have to depend all on ourselves. There are many things I can learn while sitting in the dorm such as helping each other in times of need, being independent, and being disciplined according to set rules, being on time, and more. This can help me in maintaining discipline in my lifestyle, learning what is right and what is wrong, and is a preparation for me to live independently if I am an adult. I am so thankful that I have this experience for me to be ready to face adulthood especially for me to enter the university realm. On this occasion, I am very grateful to the hostel warden, friends, and hostel students who all helped me face the difficulties throughout being a hostel student.
