I have been to Korea twice during 2013 when I was 12 years old and during 2018 when I was 17 years old. I went to Korea with all of my cousins and none of my family members went together with us except the second time I went to Korea, my younger brother followed me as he has already grown up. Also, the first time I went to Korea is during summer and the second time I went during winter. The reason we went to Korea is to send our cousin to have further study at the Inha University of Korea. Anyways, let’s get into the places that I went in Korea:

<p><font face = "Lato">The only Korean historical building that I took pictures with is Gyeongbokgung Palace, Seoul, South Korea. This building is in the centre of Seoul, Korea. We also went to the National Museum of Korea that exhibit their culture to the audience. Also, we tried out their traditional cloth called Hanbok. Then we tried out and learned how to make Kimchi, their traditional. Kimchi is cabbage coated with Korean spicy chili.

<p><font face = "Lato">Namsan Seoul Tower is the first multi-purpose tower established in Korea, becoming an iconic Korean landmark and tourist attraction representing Korea for the past 40 years. We were able to enjoy unobstructed views over the entire city of Seoul. Another highlight of the tower is the Namsan Cable Car where it transfers passengers from the foot of the mountain to the base of the tower while enjoying the view of Seoul city. Seoul Namsan Tower is also famous for its service where all tourists present can lock words or keychains on the fence around it. We also managed to lock our names there as a reminder that we had gone to Namsan Tower.

<p><font face = "Lato">Everland theme park is my favourite place that i visited in Korea. Well, probably all the children will like it. Their theme park felt like a wonderland as it is such a huge place with a lot of beautiful and exciting things. We also rode a lot of rides such as roller coasters, ghost house, etc. I remembered that we rode roller coasters 2 or 3 times and that was the very first time I rode a roller coaster in my life. Moreover, I almost forgot that there is also a zoo in the theme park. We went to see a lot of animals such as bears, pandas, lions and so forth.

<p><font face = "Lato">It is one of the famous shopping streets in Seoul, Korea. I bought a lot of clothes and other stuff. We also tried Korean Halal Street Food and it was so delicious. We also took lots of pictures together when unique items were on display like big bears and others. We also stopped to pray at Seoul Central Mosque, Korea which is a large and beautiful mosque inside and outside the building.

The view on the campus is so beautiful and the lake is also frozen as the second time we went there was during the winter. We took a lot of pictures together to be kept as memories. I hope you enjoy knowing the places that I went to in Korea. Thank you for reading.
